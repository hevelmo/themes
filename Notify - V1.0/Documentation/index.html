		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) HTML Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		
		<p>If you check the HTML code of any layout you will find that each row is highlighted with comments showing its start and end, so you can easily delete or duplicate any of them, here is a similar color formation to what you get if you open any layout in Firefox and choose View Page Source, part of the code looks like that:</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/code.jpg" alt="HTML Structure" />
		<br/><br/>
		<p><span style="color: red;">Tip:</span> It's not necessary that source code will be shown with such colors in your HTML/Text editor! If it's shown in black just search for &lt;!-- that's how all comments start.
		<br/><br/>

You can see the green comments explaining where content starts and ends, if you decided to add a row or more just copy what's between code comments and paste it! For example you want to duplicate the text with picture on the left in the layout #1, copy from the code comment &lt;!-- Start of text with picture on the left --> till &lt;!-- End of text with picture on the left --> and paste it after &lt;!-- End of text with picture on the left --> with this easy copy and paste method you can insert extra rows or delete them if you want, every row is created in separate table so it doesn't affect any other row whenever you duplicate/delete it.
	<br/><br/>
<span style="color: red;">Tip:</span> You can mix layouts and create your own, but remember to copy and paste rows within the same color folder, so you won't end with different colored rows.</p>

		<p>So, to ensure that your new styles are applied, make sure that they carry enough "weight" and that there isn't a style lower in the CSS file that is being applied after yours.</p>
