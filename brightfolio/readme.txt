Installation
---------------------------------------
In your WordPress administration area, go to 'Appearance -> Themes'. In the top there appears a new tab navigation. Click on the 'Install Themes' tab, then click the 'Upload' item in the new menu and browse for the 'brightfolio.zip' file in your computer and after locating it press the 'Install Now' button and after that 'activate' the new theme.
You can also install this theme the traditional way, by unzipping the 'brightfolio.zip' file, and upload the theme folder using an ftp client to the 'wp-content/themes' folder of your WordPress installation.
After installing the theme, go to 'Appearance -> Themes' in your WordPress administrator area, and click the 'activate' link of the newly installed theme. The theme is now the active one.
